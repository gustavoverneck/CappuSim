## Description  
**CappuSim** is a Rust software for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations based on the **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)**. This project is part of my Master's Degree in Physics and aims to provide an efficient and flexible tool for LBM simulations, leveraging [opencl](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) for GPU acceleration.  

The library is **Open Source**, and contributions are highly encouraged. Whether you're an academic researcher or just curious about fluid dynamics, you're welcome to contribute!  

## Current State and road map
**CappuSim** is currently in **beta** and is **functional**, but no yet formally validated. Stay tuned!

The possibilities for the future include:
- Temperature
- Forces
- GUI
- Multiphase fluid
- Moving boundaries
- Plasma extension

## Installation  
To use CappuSim, you will need to install specific versions of **cargo** and **rust**: 

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
To run it, clone the directory and execute it using cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gustavoverneck/CappuSim
cd CappuSim
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
```

A package installation will be available in future releases.

## Performance Results

The table below shows the **peak performance** of CappuSim for different Lattice Boltzmann velocity models (D2Q9, D3Q7, D3Q15, D3Q19, D3Q27) on various hardware devices.  
- **Vendor**: Manufacturer of the GPU (ðŸŸ© NVIDIA, ðŸŸ¦ Intel, ðŸŸ¥ AMD).
- **Device**: The tested GPU model.
- Each model column shows the maximum measured performance in average **MLUPs** (Million Lattice Updates per Second).

**How itâ€™s measured:**  
Performance is measured by running benchmark simulations for each velocity model on the listed device, recording the highest MLUPs achieved during the tests. This metric reflects how many million lattice sites the device can update per second, providing a direct comparison of computational throughput for different hardware and models.
