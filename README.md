## Description  
**LatteLab** is a Rust software for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations based on the **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)**. This project is part of my Master's Degree in Physics and aims to provide an efficient and flexible tool for LBM simulations, leveraging [opencl](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) for GPU acceleration.  

The library is **Open Source**, and contributions are highly encouraged. Whether you're an academic researcher or just curious about fluid dynamics, you're welcome to contribute!  

## Current State  
**LatteLab** is currently in **pre-alpha** version and **not yet functional**. A working **alpha version** will be available soon. Stay tuned!  

## Installation  
To use LatteLab, you will need to install specific versions of **cargo**, **rustc** and **ocl**: 

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

A package installation will be available in future releases.

## How to Use
